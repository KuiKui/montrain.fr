Simple, stable and unauthenticated instant messaging service for train users.


About
-----

After noticing that people use their smartphones on trains on a daily basis but don't talk to each other, I decided to try and create a simple instant messaging service. 
This service is extremely simple :

* no authentication
* no multimedia 
* no social networking

Just load and talk with your train mates.

Technologies

Web basics are used :

* [Symfony 1.4](http://www.symfony-project.org/)
* [jQuery 1.5](http://jquery.com/)
